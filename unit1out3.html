        <h2>3.1 Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>
        <p>
            One benefit of using IT when doing projects is the auto spell-check on most software, and if you think you've spelt something wrong you can always Google it which is another great benefit, Google also has the answers to most questions that you have trouble with.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also intellisense which gives you options of what it thinks you are trying to type which you can use tab to auto-complete and it makes coding projects a lot faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            In team projects, the ability for each member to do different parts (one member on content, one on design, one on html etc.) can increase the speed of the project and also decrease the workload of each team member.
        </p>
        <p>
            One drawback of efficiency in IT is the hardware requirements, as you work on bigger projects the processing time becomes larger in the desolation of Smaug films for instance;

        <h2>3.2 How to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
        <p>
            Some ways that you can improve productivity and efficiency in a workplace are, having a dog in the office <a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[2]</a>, weekly team events, special themed day's and other fun ways to keep your team happy and stop them getting dragged down by stress.
        </p>
        <p>
            You could also upgrade your systems with better Hardware/Software.

        <h2>3.3 Solutions to improve my own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>
        <p>
            Some ways I could improve my own productivity would be going for small walks on my 15 minute breaks instead of staying at my computer screen, also, to increase efficiency, I could get a second screen for my computer.<br>
            It would make creating websites alot easier as I could have the website on one screen and my VS Code on another screen.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-div">
        <h2>3.4 How I would test digital solutions.</h2>
        <p>
            One way of testing my website was to change its size while not full screen to see how the elements react to the change in size.<br>
            The reason we test projects is to get rid of as many bugs as possible (or all) before it gets released to the users.<br>
            With a program you test it by trying to stop the code working by giving it wrong input on purpose and seeing the result.
