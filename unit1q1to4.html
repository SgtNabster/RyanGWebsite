        <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
        <p>
            The increase of IT in buisness has affected everything from customer service to online shopping.<br>
            It is also cheaper and easier to reach your target audience to advertise online than TV/Radio.<br>
            As computers speed up it also increases the speed at which businesses can complete complex computing tasks. 
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            "Information technology fosters innovation in business. Innovation results in smarter apps, improved data storage, 
            faster processing, and wider information distribution.<br> Innovation makes businesses run more efficiently. And innovation increases value,
            enhances quality, and boosts productivity."<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall using IT has very little disadvantage, providing the software is made to purpose and hardware is maintained correctly.

        <h2>1.2 Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
        <p>
            Some methods for digital projects are things such as Agile, Kanban planning and good time management.<br>
            Also knowing what your project is aiming to achieve (what the problem is and how you will fix it for instance) is helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some other required skills are things like Attention to detail, HTML&CSS, problem solving<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[2]</a> and some programming understanding dependant on the project.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Attention to detail can help you see if anything has been missed and that all angles have been looked at.<br>
            HTML&CSS are useful for digital advertising (most products have a website these days).<br>
            problem solving is always useful in a project, looking at what went wrong or what is not working and being able to fix it.

        <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</h2>
        <p>
            In order to design and plan my website, I will use trello to ensure that all tasks that I have set myself have been completed and to look at what still needs to be done.<br><br>
            My trello can be found <a href= "https://trello.com/b/MPzvtOjD/ryan-glossop-website-project" target="_blank">Here</a>.<br><br>
            Using trello in this way means that i'm also following a kanban type of project, as I have to-do, doing and done tasks that I can view and change as needed.<br>
            <br>
            Another program I used for planning was Visual Basic Code.
            I designed my website by first writing all of the answers to these challenges in a HTML File so that i can see the layout (even if only a basic one) rather than having to do it later.<br><br>
            This involves all questions being inside a div element with a paragraph and header, so that it can be copy and pasted into the completed webpage when ready.

        <h2>1.4 Risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
        <p>
            The biggest risk in all digital project's is a failure to plan, this is why most projects use risk mitigation, which is used to plan for any risk that may arise in a project.
