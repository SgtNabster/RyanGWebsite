        <h2>1.1 Describing the layout and content of each page.</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to go for the same layout on all pages to make it look as clean as possible, each page has a navigation bar anchored to the top with my name and nav buttons.<br> The body of each page I gave a margin which is the same as the height of the nav-bar so that the main content is visible. <br>
            I made the content center aligned as I believe it looks nicer than left aligned text, and alot of websites have their text in the center. (facebook, twitter etc.)<br>
            In the footer of each page I placed the links to the references which I used.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided that my home page should contain a welcome message and also the about me section, so that it is the first bit a visitor sees.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Unit 1 Outcome 1 had the most questions, I decided to place the content of that into two pages. These pages contain the Unit 1 Outcome 1 Questions 1-4 and Questions 5-7 respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my next 3 pages; <br>
            As unit 1 outcome 2 & 3 and Unit 2 Outcome 1 had less overall questions I decided it would be better to have all questions answers on a single page so that all pages have a similar amount of answers to them.

        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
        <p>
            Copyright affects websites in multiple ways, a lot of pre-existing technologies have been copyrighted by one company or another
            so most new websites need to make sure they don't steal intellectual property by accident and ensure that the images / designs used
            are royalty-free or made from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other constraints affecting websites involve<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[1]</a>;
            <ul>
                <li class="desc-list">Client constraints - Keeping to client constraints can be hard, straying to far from their company ethos could end in them rejecting the website</li>
                <li class="desc-list">Project constraints - Budget, Deadlines etc. </li>
                <li class="desc-list">User experience - Ensuring the website is pleasant to look at and viewable on multiple devices/operating systems.</li>

        <h2>1.6 Access issues that need taking into account.</h2>
        <p>
            One issue that can be fixed pretty easily is making sure your web page is screen-reader friendly for those with poor eyesight.<br>
            This involves making sure that your web page doesn't have too much clutter, is structured well and the image alt text is descriptive<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[2]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ensuring your website has a tab through order is also high on the priority list<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[3]</a>.
            Making sure the buttons on the page are defined enough to be seen and stand out is also required, along with ensuring no important information is shown as an image,
            as screen readers can't read that.
