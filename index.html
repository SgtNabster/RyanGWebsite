            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>
            My name is Ryan Glossop, I got on to Code-Nation through the Working Well programme.<br>
            <br>
            I have always had an interest in coding but, due to personal reasons, I was not able to complete my studies at university,
            luckily the working well programme placed me on this course and although I have done this kind of thing before it's been
            real fun getting to code again.<br>
            <br>
            In the future I would love to get a job as a software developer either through the creation of apps or making games.<br>
            I like to learn Unreal Engine in my spare time however my computer isn't strong enough to generate landscapes
            so, until I can upgrade my PC i'm on a break from learning this.
