        <h2>2.1 Review of IT tools I used.</h2>
        <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is a coding platform with multiple options, it can be used for programming or for websites and other projects.<br>
            This is a great way of having a Tech-Stack with multiple file types created on one editor.
        </p>
        <h3>Trello</h3>
        <p>
            Trello is a way of organising your projects into small manageable chunks so that you can see what needs doing, what is being done and what is done. (A form of kanban)<br> It is useful when managing a project as it helps see what is going on at a glance.

        <h2>2.2 Effectiveness of tools used.</h2>
        <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
        <p>
            Having used Notepad++ in the past (This was 4 years ago so it may have changed)
            I find Visual Studio Code to be a much greater option and more efficient due mainly to the fact you can download new extentions straight from the editor and also, for not needing to swap between multiple editors to do everything.
        </p>
        <h3>Trello</h3>
        <p>
            Trello is an amazing tool to organise everything I need to do at once. <br> It allows me to split every outcome into its own done pile, have a to-do pile with a main to-do, like answer all outcome 2 questions and in the description I can write every question i've done so I can see easy how close to being finished the whole outcome is. <br> I also have singular cards for each question to store the answer on.

        <h2>2.3. Strengths and weaknesses of my final project.</h2>
        <p>
            Some strengths of my final project are; <br>
            I believe my website is accessible as it is clearly structured so
            screen readers can parse it easily, it is also not very cluttered so you can find each question easily. <br>
            The nav bar is simple and also responsive to page size which was not part of the specification but I added as a challenge to myself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some weaknesses are; <br>
            The colour scheme is not the best, and when you press the nav button on a small screen the menu hides some text rather than moving the text down. <br>
            It is also quite boring, though I have made sure it is easily read, it is just lines of block text which looks dull.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I am happy with the final product with the time given and I am quite proud to have learned and incorporated some Javascript.

        <h2>2.4 Further improvements I can make to this project.</h2>
        <p>
            If I had more time I could of added quite a few things to the project, some of these ideas are; <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            More responsive design, <br>
            Although the website works on my computer, I didn't test it on any other browser than Chrome to see how it works, I would also of tested it on other OS's if I had access to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Colour Scheme/aesthetics, <br>
            Overall the website is extremely dull, although I tried to keep a simple colour scheme I find it to be really ugly so I would spend some time looking at how other websites mix and match colours to be nicer on the eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            More content, <br>
            As the specification only asked for a paragraph I had to shorten my answers down, I felt like a paragraph or two wasnt enough to fully explain everything that was asked.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-div">
        <h2>2.5 Review Of Outcomes.</h2>
        <p>
            One of the ways my website is fit for purpose is that the content included in this site is appropriate for what the specification asked for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way my website is fit for purpose is that I have edited and formatted it in a way that is easy to read and you can easily see what questions are where.
