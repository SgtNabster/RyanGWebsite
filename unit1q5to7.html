        <h2>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
        <p>
            Before starting a project you must decide what technologies you will use first, when deciding what to use you must think about the up-scalability of the project.
            (in case it has higher demand than first predicted).<br> How you will protect the users security (card details etc) and ofcourse how fast the project needs to be completed.<br>
            if the project needs to be completed quickly, then a pre-made "Tech-Stack" will be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using front and back end technologies together,
            you create what is called a "Tech-stack" this is usually decided based upon the requirements of the project (a shopping website has less requirements 
            than a AAA game for instance) however to save money / be more efficient a lot of companies now use pre-made tech-stacks which can be more reliable.
            <br><br>
            An example of a tech-stack is the LAMP stack, which<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[1]</a>; 
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            "Combines Linux OS, Apache web server, MySQL database, PHP / Perl / Python. This tech stack can be called an industry standard. 
            It is used to develop web applications and is popular for its adaptability, security and open source. 
            LAMP is often chosen to increase efficiency and reduce development costs."
        </p>

        <h2>1.6 How my chosen technologies have helped me.</h2>
        <h3>Trello</h3>
        <p>
            Trello has helped me to complete my projects in multiple ways.<br> First, in the group project it helped to delegate tasks between group members and to
            see at a glance who had to do what next.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my solo project it has helped me plan what needs doing in advance and also see what I haven't completed yet.<br> Breaking
            the tasks down into manageable chunks has really helped me keep on top of everything that needs doing.
        </p>
        <h3>Git/Github</h3>
        <p>
            Although I haven't used Git/Github in this project I have used them before, when learning how to use the Unreal Engine, once you commit a file to Git it saves it there and
            allows you to roll back your code to that point if any issues show up.<br> For instance if you are creating a game, you could work on the main menu, save it because it works, 
            then add a few extra bits at the same time, but if your code stops working, you can roll back to the main menu upload and restart from a point that definitely works.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see Git/GitHub is an amazing tool for version control in both single person projects and huge group projects, allowing for collaborative work to be iterated on while still having working
            back-ups ready in case one "cog in the machine" breaks.
        </p>

        <h2>1.7 Legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest constraint impacting digital projects is GDPR or the General Data Protection Regulation.<br><br>
            The GDPR website explains this as -
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), 
            it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018. 
            The GDPR will levy harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros.<a class="ref-point" href="#bottom">[2]</a>"
        </p>
        <p>
            A company I worked for once broke GDPR due to unsolicited emails, a customer requested that they be removed from the mailing list, once this happens the company has one month
            to remove said customer from the list.<br> However, the request was not actioned in time and the customer was still receiving emails, the customer was awarded their court costs, Â£30 per email
            and also a lump sum for the hassle caused, this shows how serious compliance to GDPR is.
        </p>
